/**
 * This class is a placeholder for the static methods that are used
 * for creating all the Connection objects.
 * <p>
 * The creation of Connections is performed dynamically by looking
 * up a protocol implementation class whose name is formed from the
 * platform name (read from a system property) and the protocol name
 * of the requested connection (extracted from the parameter string
 * supplied by the application programmer.)
 *
 * The parameter string that describes the target should conform
 * to the URL format as described in RFC 2396.
 * This takes the general form:
 * <p>
 * <code>{scheme}:[{target}][{parms}]</code>
 * <p>
 * where <code>{scheme}</code> is the name of a protocol such as
 * <i>http</i>}.
 * <p>
 * The <code>{target}</code> is normally some kind of network
 * address.
 * <p>
 * Any <code>{parms}</code> are formed as a series of equates
 * of the form ";x=y".  Example: ";type=a".
 * <p>
 * An optional second parameter may be specified to the open
 * function. This is a mode flag that indicates to the protocol
 * handler the intentions of the calling code. The options here
 * specify if the connection is going to be read (READ), written
 * (WRITE), or both (READ_WRITE). The validity of these flag
 * settings is protocol dependent. For instance, a connection
 * for a printer would not allow read access, and would throw
 * an IllegalArgumentException. If the mode parameter is not
 * specified, READ_WRITE is used by default.
 * <p>
 * An optional third parameter is a boolean flag that indicates
 * if the calling code can handle timeout exceptions. If this
 * flag is set, the protocol implementation may throw an
 * InterruptedIOException when it detects a timeout condition.
 * This flag is only a hint to the protocol handler, and it
 * does not guarantee that such exceptions will actually be thrown.
 * If this parameter is not set, no timeout exceptions will be
 * thrown.
 * <p>
 * Because connections are frequently opened just to gain access
 * to a specific input or output stream, four convenience
 * functions are provided for this purpose.
 *
 * See also: {@link DatagramConnection DatagramConnection}
 * for information relating to datagram addressing
 *
 * @version 1.1 1/7/2000
 * @version 1.2 12/8/2000 (comments revised)
