* Build

   We are using maven2 to build project

   To build project you need this environment variables:
    JAVA_HOME, SWT_HOME (to build swt module) and WTK_HOME to compile and test MIDlets.
    PATH variable should contain %JAVA_HOME%\bin for WTK preverify to work.
   Also You may need to set MAVEN_OPTS=-Xmx256M if you are getting java.lang.OutOfMemoryError during build

   To create Eclipse projects run:
     mvn eclipse:clean eclipse:eclipse -DdownloadSources=true

   To run build without tests:
     mvn -Dmaven.test.skip=true

   To build distribution assembly e.g. microemulator-2.X.X.tar.gz:
     mvn -DperformRelease=true

     distribution pakage would be created in microemulator\target\microemulator-2.X.X.tar.gz

* Building official Release by the MicroEmulator team.

    * Test locally

        mvn clean deploy site-deploy -P release -DperformRelease=true -Dlabel=2.0.2

    * Remove all -SNAPSHOT from pom.xml

    * Remove/comment SNAPSHOT <pluginRepositories> used in poms if any.

    * Update src/changes.xml

    * Comment out sections marked <!--4release--> and <!--4snapshot--> in src/site/site.xml

    * Update variable demoLocation in microemu-examples/microemu-demo HTTPPanel.java

    * SVN commit

    * On build server (CruiseControl)  https://pyx4j.com/cruisecontrol/ start  "me2-release"
      It will execute:
        mvn -o clean --fail-never -P release
        mvn -o scm:update -P release
        mvn -o clean deploy site-deploy -P release -DperformRelease=true

    * repository "pyx4j.com-file-release" (http://pyx4j.com/maven2-release/) on build server will sync with http://repo1.maven.org/maven2

    * Upload the context of /home/apache/microemu (http://pyx4j.com/snapshot/microemu-release)  to http://microemu.org/

    * Upload the distribution jars microemulator-2.X.X-sources.tar.gz and microemulator-2.X.X.tar.gz to sf.net

       Files location: http://pyx4j.com/snapshot/microemu-release/microemulator/download/

    * Create Tag in SVN

    * Update version to  (x+1)-SNAPSHOT

    * Update src/site/site.xml reverse changes for <!--4release--> and <!--4snapshot-->

* cruisecontrol

    "me2" Every 1 hour:
        clean --fail-never -P build|scm:update -P build|clean install -P build

    "me2-nightly" 3AM EST
        clean --fail-never -P build|scm:update -P build|clean deploy site-deploy -P build

* error classpath configuration error, Wrong Injected class detected. microemu-injected module should be after microemu-javase in eclipse

  This is the problem that order of dependancies in maven is undefined.

  To solve: In eclipse edit project  microemu-javase-swing  move microemu-injected down.

  In fact it should not even be there as project (bug in maven-eclipse plugin), only jar microemu-injected-2.0.1-SNAPSHOT-inject.jar is required!
  The best option to remove this dependacncy from eclipse project.


* Building applet

  This describe procedure for building applet.

  We run proguard 3 times with deferent options
   on microemu-cldc and microemu-midp we need to preserve all API declarations
   on microemu-javase+microemu-javase-swing assembly we just need to preserve main applet class.

* Building Web Start

   We are using signed Web Start.
   The microemu-webstart module is created to be build by primary ME2 developers only because it involves signing jars with our keys.
   The module can still be used by other as reference. Please see microemu-webstart\key.txt

   microemu-webstart module is not part of regular build
   To build webstart module use
    mvn -P webstart
   When building all application.
   This is because some users may get ME2 SVN tree and try to compile.
   The microemu-webstart will fail for them.
